# A-custom-Neural-Network-from-scratch

This is divided into mainly 3 parts
  -- Machine Learning
  -- using Keras
  -- using a custom Model

creating a Custom Model is the main aim of this Repo

You can have a look at all the theories [Here](https://github.com/KoteshwarChinnolla/A-custom-Neural-Network-from-scratch-/blob/main/theory_Neural_network.ipynb). where I followed all maths to create a model

It is always fascinating to implement what we have learnt theoretically. It would be way more interesting if we tried to build something that amazed us some time back. 

If you want to have a look at the process I followed while building it [Visit](https://github.com/KoteshwarChinnolla/A-custom-Neural-Network-from-scratch-/blob/main/deep_leaqrning%20copy.ipynb) this include implementing maths to automating whole processes.

the model i built is over [here](https://github.com/KoteshwarChinnolla/A-custom-Neural-Network-from-scratch-/tree/main/customNNs)
